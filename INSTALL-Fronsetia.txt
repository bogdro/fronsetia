JavaEE server configuration

Consult your JavaEE server manual about how to configure your particular
server for deployment of applications, like creating a domain (if needed),
creating managed servers (if needed), etc.

For Eclipse Jetty, you need to create a base directory you will be deploying
the application to. To do that (in bash syntax):

- unpack the Jetty distribution
- run 'cd jetty-home-x.y.z'
- run 'export JETTY_HOME=`pwd`'
- run 'mkdir base-dir' (or use your chosen name)
- run 'cd base-dir'
- run 'export JETTY_BASE=`pwd`'
- run
  java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-module=server,http,deploy,webapp,jsp
  to create the server configuration
- run 'java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar' to start the server

How to install:

Install the required JAR files (and their dependencies) on your server's
CLASSPATH (unless you've built a self-contained package with all the required
libraries inside) - see the README file.

Installation of Fronsetia:
- deploy the WAR file on your application server.

The exact method depends on your server. Examples:
- Apache Tomcat: copy the WAR file to 'apache-tomcat-x.y.z/webapps',
  (or deploy manually using the server console)
- Eclipse Jetty: copy the WAR file to '$JETTY_BASE/webapps',
- WildFly: copy the WAR file to 'wildfly-x.y.z/standalone/deployments'
  (or deploy manually using the server console)
- Eclipse GlassFish: copy the WAR file to
  'glassfishX/glassfish/domains/<domain name>/autodeploy/'
  (or deploy manually using the server console)
