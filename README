================================================================

Requirements for compiling the application:

- the development kit for the Java language (JDK),

- Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org).

Type 'mvn package' to compile the application.
Alternatively, you can use a 'make' utility and run just 'make' (which
 calls Maven now anyway).

You can also build a self-contained package with all the required libraries
inside by removing all

	<scope>provided</scope>

tags from pom.xml and re-building the application.

================================================================

How to run:

Deploy the application on your server with the following JAR files
(and their dependencies) on the server's CLASSPATH (unless you've built
a self-contained package with all the required libraries inside):

- wsdl4j.jar (1.6.2 is OK) - the WSDL4J project (http://wsdl4j.sf.net/),
- xbean.jar (2.5.0 is OK) - the Apache XmlBeans (https://xmlbeans.apache.org/),
- httpclient.jar (4.1.1 is OK) - the Apache HttpComponents
  (https://hc.apache.org/),
- httpcore.jar (4.1 is OK) - the Apache HttpComponents,
- commons-logging.jar (1.1.1 is OK) - the Apache HttpComponents
- servlet-api.jar - from your JavaEE servlet container/server
- axiom.jar (1.2.12 is OK) - Apache Axiom (https://ws.apache.org/axiom/)
- axis2-saaj.jar (1.6.1 is OK) - Apache Axis2
  (https://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/)
- commons-codec.jar (1.5 is OK) - Apache Commons Codec
  (https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/)

================================================================

How to use:

1. Access the application on the server from a browser
2. Type the WSDL address and proceed
3. Choose the operation to run, fill the data and press the button with
   the operation's name.

You can start from the page with the list of operations by passing the
 address of the WSDL file in the URL.
