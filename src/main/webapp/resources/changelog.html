<p>
ChangeLog of SOAP Service Tester:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>2012-06-05	Bogdan Drozdowski<br><br>
  <ul>
	<li> SOAPServiceTester version 0.3<br>
	  Allow changing the character set used for parsing the server's
	  replies, if can't be detected automatically. Fixed problems
	  reported by the "findbugs" and "jlint" programs. Allow all SSL certificates
	  (as an option).<br><br></li>
	<li> resources/soaptester.css: bakground on anchors is now inherited
	  <br><br></li>
	<li> WSDLCheck.java: made wsdlLocation non-static to allow concurrent
	  runs. Changed untyped references (raw types) to have the &lt;?&gt; type.
	  <br><br></li>
	<li> RequestUtilities.java (makeHTMLSafe): added the ampersand to the
	  list of replaced characters.<br><br></li>
	<li> Makefile: corrected the WAR file creation<br><br></li>
	<li> OperationLauncher.java (perform): using the provided charset (and
	  the one from RequestUtilities, not the platform default, if no
	  charset was provided by the user) when the charset can't be
	  detected from the HTTP reply. Allow all SSL certificates (when
	  the right option is enabled on the JSP page).<br><br></li>
	<li> show_operations.jsp, perform_operation.jsp: allow setting the
	  character set for parsing the server's replies. A new option
	  to allow using SSL with no verification.<br><br></li>
	<li> OperationLauncher.java (getRespHeaders): checking the response
	  for null (may happen in case of exceptions)<br><br></li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>2011-12-15	Bogdan Drozdowski<br><br>
  <ul>
	<li> SOAPServiceTester version 0.2<br>
	  Support for: authentication, proxy servers, protocol name and
	  version. More control over the headers sent. Moved more operations
	  to dedicated classes from JSP pages. Interpreting the SOAP response.
	  Verified working with the jetty server.<br><br></li>
	<li> RequestUtilities.java: a new class with things related to requests
	  passed to SOAPServiceTester (to the JSP pages) and data display.
	  The names of the forms' elements are now in a separate place.<br><br></li>
	<li> OperationLauncher.java: a new class that prepares the data for
	  calling the operation, calls it and processes response data.<br><br></li>
	<li> footer.html, resources/img: added the valid HTML/CSS icons.<br><br></li>
	<li> show_operations.jsp, perform_operation.jsp: added the Cache-Control
	  and Pragma HTTP-equiv META elements.<br><br></li>
	<li> SOAPInterpreter.java: a new class for reading SOAP responses,
	  checking if there was a SOAP Fault and getting the responses' types
	  (names of the XML elements in the SOAP Body).<br><br></li>
	<li> show_operations.jsp: allow choosing the protocol type, version and
	  method. Allow disabling and overriding the default headers. Allow
	  using a proxy (with optional proxy authentication). Catching WSDL
	  processing errors.<br><br></li>
	<li> perform_operation.jsp: added IDs for the request and response fields,
	  displaying the operation's name in the page title, fixed exception
	  display, added interpreting the SOAP response. Moved calling the
	  operation and reading the response to new classes. Displaying the
	  protocol type, version and method used to send the request.
	  Corrected behaviour when connection was refused. Displaying the
	  proxy and proxy authentication data that was used. Displaying the
	  authentication data that was used. Better exception display. Using
	  scrollbars in PRE elements to fit the data on the screen.<br><br></li>
	<li> Makefile: added axis2-saaj.jar and axiom.jar to class path, added
	  classes to compile: RequestUtilities.java, OperationLauncher.java
	  and SOAPInterpreter.java. Corrected creating the distribution and
	  other Makefile targets.<br><br></li>
